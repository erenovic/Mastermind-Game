# Mastermind-Game
An implementation of the Master Mind Game in MATLAB.

Mastermind is the popular number guessing game. Person A picks a four-digit
number, where any numeral is not repeated in more than one digit. Person B tries to
guess the number. After every guess, Person A tells how many digits exist in the
original number and are in the correct positions, and how many exist but are in wrong
positions. Correctly positioned digits are indicated with (+), and misplaced ones are
shown with (-) prefix.
